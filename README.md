# CHIME - ChatGPT Inaccuracy Mitigation Engine

**Overview**

CHIME is designed to improve the accuracy of responses generated by ChatGPT. This engine leverages various preprocessing and validation techniques to enhance the correctness of answers, specifically tailored for software engineering tasks.

**Data**
* BenchmarkQA: Contains 412 Question and Verification Answer pairs, divided equally between the OpenJ9 and ElasticSearch projects. (Section IV)
* Database: Includes a separate database with both structured and unstructured issue bodies processed through the Issue Processor.

**Results**
* Output: Generated actual answers of benchamark question got from different processing methods.
* Overall Result.csv: Correctness of each process to evaluate performance improvements.

**Survey**
* Benchmark Survey (Section III)
* Usefulness Survey (Section VII.C)

**Code**
* CHIME.ipynb : Includes the code of core processing pipeline of CHIME, correctness evaluation and accuracy measurement of cfg
